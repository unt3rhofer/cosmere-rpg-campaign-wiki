|Pair of Spanreeds|1|Spanreeds come in pairs,  with each reed conjoined to the other, allowing for the  bearers of each to communicate over long distances.  Each spanreed is a writing utensil with an infused ruby  at the top. When one bearer twists the ruby to activate  it, their spanreed causes the paired spanreed’s ruby  to blink, signaling that communication is requested.  When the other spanreed bearer is ready, they twist  their spanreed’s ruby, and the two reeds begin to move  in parallel. By taking turns writing, the bearers can  conduct written conversations. Both spanreeds must  be stationary for them to work, preventing their use  on boats, in carriages, and in similar situations. A pair  of spanreeds expend 1 charge for every 5 days they  are active.|
|Emotion Bracelet|1|Emotion bracelets blink or change color in the presence of different emotions. The bracelet’s wearer can spend 1 charge as [>] to gain an advantage on an Insight test against a character within 10 feet of them.|
